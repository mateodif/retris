A very simple Tetris clone. Made in Rust using macroquad.

I simply couldn't think of a better name.

** TO-DO

- Add simple game mechanics (pause, timer, points, etc)
- Add textures instead of simple color rectangles
- Add music
- Check if WASM and other backends behave correctly
- Add levels and other kind of fancy stuff
